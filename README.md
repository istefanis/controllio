# Controllio

![app](https://github.com/istefanis/controllio/blob/main/assets/img/app.png)

A web app which lets Control Systems engineers design & experiment with LTI (linear time-invariant) dynamical systems online.

So far, functionality has been implemented for:

- the analytical computation of the overall transfer function (tf) of a system modeled by interconnected elements in the s-domain
- the generation of its Bode and Nyquist plots

_Predefined circuits are also included, ex. PI, PD and PID controllers_

## Motivation

The motivation behind Controllio is to provide a fast web-based open-source drafting table for studying control systems, which:

- runs on the browser without any installation, and is mobile-friendly
- is written in a widely-used programming language (vanilla Javascript), and can be easily extended

## Try it out
